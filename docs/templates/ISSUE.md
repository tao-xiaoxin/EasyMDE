## Summary

## Expected behavior

Describe the observable outcome that should be true after the Issue is resolved.

## Scope

- Included:
- Excluded:
- Compatibility constraints:

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The intended behavior is implemented or documented.
- [ ] Relevant failure and cancellation paths are covered.
- [ ] Existing supported behavior remains compatible.
- [ ] Appropriate tests or validation are added or updated.
- [ ] Public text and artifacts pass the privacy checks below.
- [ ] Closing this Issue still requires explicit human maintainer confirmation after the criteria are met.

## Validation or reproduction

Provide the smallest privacy-safe reproduction, test expectation, or verification plan.
Use redacted examples and behavior descriptions instead of raw sensitive evidence.

## Privacy and public artifact check

- [ ] No credentials, tokens, cookies, authorization headers, private keys, or local configuration values are included.
- [ ] No absolute local paths, usernames, home directories, temporary paths, screenshot paths, private endpoints, or internal service details are included unless they are an intentional non-sensitive public contract.
- [ ] No personal data, private article content, raw browser storage, HAR data, or unnecessary logs are included.
- [ ] Any attached image, archive, font, SVG, binary, or data URI has been checked for unnecessary EXIF, XMP, IPTC, geolocation, creator-tool, document-ID, instance-ID, or machine metadata.
- [ ] User-provided reference screenshots or files are not committed or republished unless publication is necessary, authorized, and privacy-reviewed.
